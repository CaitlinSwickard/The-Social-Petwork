# The Social Petwork - Project 3

This project is a social media application for pets! This app has the ability for a user to register/signup. Once the user is logged in they are directed to the feedpage. On the feedpage the user can see a timeline of other users posts. There the user can like a post from another user. A logged in user can create a new post. They have the ability to update that post as well as delete the post.
